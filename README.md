The purpose of this quiz is to challenge the user’s preconceptions of dinosaurs, in regards to which geologic period different species lived in. Many people mistakenly believe that certain dinosaurs cohabited (due to misinformation in the media and entertainment). It can also be used as a tool to teach younger children about the 3 major time periods that dinosaurs lived in. My intent is to inform, but also to keep score. At the end of the game, there will be an option to play again or view the answers.

User #1:
  Adult who grew up watching the Jurassic Park series and thinks that the dinosaur species presented in the movie actually lived in the same time period with each other.
User #2:
  Child who is learning about dinosaurs and has only seen media geared toward children that conveys the idea that dinosaurs lived ‘a long time ago’ but with no distinction of different eras.

As a user, I will :
- open the game titled, ‘Dinosaur Quiz’
- see the title page with an image of dinosaurs living harmoniously together
- see the name of the game, a tagline, then underneath the image, the instructions and  a button that says, ’Start Game!’
- click the ’Start Game!’ button and be directed to the next page which starts the      questions
- see at the top of the page, which number question I’m on, an image and name of the    dinosaur, and a clickable list of answers
- having read the instructions on the first page, I will attempt to select the correct  geological period that I think the dinosaur lives in
- click on the ’Next’ button to proceed to the next question. The choices for each      question will be in different orders each time, for variety.
- having answered all the questions, be taken to the final page, where I will see a     message that tells me how many questions I answered correctly
- be able to choose between viewing the answers by clicking the button ‘View Answers’ on the bottom-left of the page or start the game again by clicking the ‘Play Again’ button on the bottom-right of the page
- if I choose ‘View Answers’, I will be taken to a page that displays an image of the timeline of the respective dinosaurs and a list of question numbers/dinosaurs and their corresponding correct answers
- if I choose ‘Play Again’, the page will refresh to the beginning and the game will begin again, but with randomized dinosaurs

Technology:
- HTML: to structure each page using divs
- CSS: styling of my game to include photos, animations, colors, and other visual stimuli
- JS: to include clickable buttons, interactive multiple-choice questions, the ability to reset the game or view the correct answers, input of sounds for win/lose page

Stretch goals:
- timer that counts down for each question
- score as a percentage/ option to win or lose based on a minimum score percentage
- animations on the final page 
- dinosaur sounds for the win and lose options
- button for each dinosaur that creates a pop op with additional fun fact about that dino


Data Structure:
- Layout :
	I would like to structure the pages with the use of divs, since I don’t have much experience with them.
- Questions: 
	The multiple-choice answers on each page will be organized in arrays, with each answer being a string/object. I will be using looping methods to generate the answer choices on each page, 	 at random.
- Media: 
       I will be using still formats and hopefully, gifs/animations, audio (sounds for the win/lose page).
